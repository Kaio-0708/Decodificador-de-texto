# Text Decoder Project

In partnership with Alura Latam and Oracle, I'm thrilled to present an innovative project developed as part of Challenge ONE: Build a Text Decoder with JavaScript from the ONE-Oracle Next Education program! This project showcases my journey and learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to acquire unique knowledge and skills throughout this development process.

## Project Overview

The Text Decoder is a web-based application that provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt text using a set of predefined "keys". The project is designed to work with lowercase letters only and does not support accents or special characters.

### Encryption Keys
- `e` → `enter`
- `i` → `imes`
- `a` → `ai`
- `o` → `ober`
- `u` → `ufat`

### Features
- **Encryption**: Convert plain text into an encrypted format using the specified keys.
- **Decryption**: Convert encrypted text back to its original form.
- **User Interface**: Includes a user-friendly interface with the following components:
  - A text area for inputting text to be encrypted or decrypted.
  - Buttons to trigger encryption or decryption processes.
  - A section to display the result of the operation.
  - A copy button to easily copy the result to the clipboard.
  - A theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

### Technical Details
- **Languages Used**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic theme toggle for user preference (light/dark mode).
  - Validation to ensure only lowercase letters are processed.
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes using media queries.

This project demonstrates my ability to implement creative solutions using web technologies, showcasing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application highlights practical skills in user interface design and interactive features, providing a robust and engaging user experience.
