In partnership with Alura Latam and Oracle, I'm excited to present an incredible project developed as part of Challenge ONE: Build a Text Decoder with JavaScript from the ONE-Oracle Next Education program! Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude for participating and learning unique knowledge throughout my development as a programmer.

This project uses the following encryption "keys": "e" for "enter" "i" for "imes" "a" for "ai" "o" for "ober" "u" for "ufat"

Project requirements: Works with lowercase letters only. No letters with accents or special characters are used. Allows you to convert a word to the encrypted version and return an encrypted word to the original version.

This exemplary project demonstrates power and creativity, highlighting my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Check out a sample of the project in action:
