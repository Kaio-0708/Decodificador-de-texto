# Text Decoder Project

In partnership with Alura Latam and Oracle, I'm excited to present an incredible project developed as part of Challenge ONE: Build a Text Decoder with JavaScript from the ONE-Oracle Next Education program! Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude for participating and learning unique knowledge throughout my development as a programmer.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the following encryption "keys":
- `e` for `enter`
- `i` for `imes`
- `a` for `ai`
- `o` for `ober`
- `u` for `ufat`

### Project Requirements

- **Lowercase Letters Only**: The decoder works with lowercase letters exclusively.
- **No Accents or Special Characters**: The project does not handle letters with accents or special characters.
- **Convert Between Versions**: The application allows you to convert a word to its encrypted version and return an encrypted word to its original version.

This exemplary project demonstrates power and creativity, showcasing my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
